## 1. Introduction

This report provides insights into a data warehousing project conducted by PayMinute, a leading FinTech company operating in Nigeria and Kenya. The project's primary focus is on the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) process, leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance data management. Key concepts and relevant project details are elaborated upon in the following sections.

## 2. Data Integration Process

The heart of this project lies in the Data Integration process, a crucial aspect of ETL:

### Extraction

In the Extraction phase, data is retrieved from the source system, primarily a PostgreSQL database.

### Transformation

Data undergoes significant transformations to align with the desired data warehousing schema. This may involve cleansing, aggregating, or restructuring the data as necessary.

### Loading

Transformed data finds its new home in an AWS S3 Data Lake, serving as the target data storage system for this project.

## 3. Project Overview

### Business Case: PayMinute FinTech

PayMinute, a dynamic FinTech firm with over 5000 active users across Nigeria and Kenya, has been experiencing data-related challenges. Growing transaction volumes have resulted in delays and concerns about data accuracy among their data analysts. In response, PayMinute has enlisted the expertise of a skilled Big Data Engineer.

## 4. Process Flow

The project follows a meticulously planned process flow, encompassing the following stages:

### Fetching Data from PostgreSQL to AWS S3

Data extraction is accomplished from a PostgreSQL database using Pandas and Boto3. Extracted data is securely stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

### Copying Tables from S3 to Redshift (Raw)

Tables from the S3 bucket are copied into Amazon Redshift, signifying the "Raw Data" schema.

### Executing Create Statements in the Warehouse's Staging Environment

SQL create statements are meticulously executed in the Redshift staging environment, establishing the foundational schema structure.

### Transforming the Dataset

Data transformation becomes a pivotal phase, where data is reshaped to align with the predefined Star Schema or other chosen schemas.

### Loading Data into the Staging Environment

The transformed data is skillfully loaded into the Redshift staging environment using SQL scripts.

## 5. Business Case

PayMinute's primary goal is to improve data retrieval efficiency and enhance data accuracy for its data analysts. Consequently, the organization has decided to embrace a data warehousing solution. By leveraging AWS services, the project aims to deliver a robust ETL process, thereby optimizing data management.

## 6. Guidelines

The project adheres to a set of guiding principles:

- Data extraction from PostgreSQL to AWS S3 is achieved using Pandas and Boto3.
- Tables are systematically copied from the S3 bucket to Amazon Redshift, residing in the "Raw Data" schema.
- SQL create statements are meticulously executed within the Redshift staging environment.
- Data undergoes transformation to fit the predefined Star Schema or other chosen schemas.
- The transformed data is then expertly loaded into the staging environment using SQL scripts.

## 7. Code Implementation

The provided code snippet serves as a demonstration of the data extraction and loading process, leveraging AWS services and PostgreSQL. This code adheres to the ETL paradigm, ensuring that data is appropriately transformed and loaded into the desired schema, ready for further analysis.

Please note that the code presented here is a partial representation, and a comprehensive project implementation would entail additional components for data transformation, loading into a star schema, and scheduling ETL jobs as needed.
